# jpg2png

Converts and crops jpg and png files to a png output file on Windows Operating Systems.

# Usage
jpg2png <input_filename> <output_PNG_filename>

# Details
This command is useful to call as a utility process from your code when you need to crop a PNG or JPG and get it into PNG format.
I use it for our Raising Awesome Carver application.  There is also code within Program.cs for resizing that is not yet implemented.  Pull Requests are welcome!
